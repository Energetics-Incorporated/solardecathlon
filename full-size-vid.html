			<h3>What Is Solar Decathlon?</h3>
			<p>Solar Decathlon is a biennial collegiate competition made up of 10 contests that challenge student teams to design and build full-size, solar-powered houses. The winner of the competition is the team that best blends design excellence and smart energy production with innovation, market potential, and energy and water efficiency.</p>
			<p>The Solar Decathlon is much more than a collegiate competition. It’s an intensive course in sustainable practices for the participating college students. For visitors, it’s an informative demonstration that includes energy efficient design, clean energy technologies, and more! Solar Decathlon 2017 will feature a sustainability expo, professional development and consumer workshops, middle school education events, and a community festival.</p>
			<p>Solar Decathlon 2017 will be located in Denver, Colorado, adjacent to the 61st &amp Peña Station on the University of Colorado A line commuter train that connects Denver International Airport to Union Station in downtown Denver.</p>

Solar Decathlon 2017 will be located within the mixed-use development at the 61st and Peña Station. The City and County of Denver, and the Denver International Airport partnered with Panasonic and Xcel Energy to create a national model for sustainable, transit-oriented, development that can enhance the region’s overall economic competitiveness.
